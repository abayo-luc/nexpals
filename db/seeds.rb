Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\" title=\"Content management system\">content management systems</a> or CMS. These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary or open source. In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware between the database and the user through the browser. A principle benefit of a CMS is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their web site without having technical knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer\" title=\"Web developer\">web developers</a>) and follow standard methods like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\" title=\"Agile software development\">Agile methodologies</a> while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_designer\" title=\"Graphic designer\">graphic designer</a> or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems\" title=\"Information systems\">information systems</a> technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kind of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.</p>\r\n", intro: "Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
